 * @param pvStartParam Pointer to the parameter to pass to the thread function.
 * @param dwCreateFlags Creation flags to use when creating the new thread.
 * @param pdwThreadId Pointer to the buffer that will receive the thread ID (optional).
 * @return Handle to the new thread.
 * @retval NULL Indicates an error, which can be retrieved with \c GetLastError().
 * @remark This function has been put in place to wrap up the handling of creating remote threads
 *         in privileged processes across all operating systems. In Windows XP and earlier, the
 *         \c CreateRemoteThread() function was sufficient to handle this case, however this changed
 *         in Vista and has been that way since. For Vista onwards, the use of the hidden API function
 *         \c RtlCreateUserThread() is required. This function attempts to use \c CreateRemoteThread()
 *         first and if that fails it will fall back to \c RtlCreateUserThread(). This means that the
 *         existing behaviour is kept for when running on XP and earlier, or when the user is already
 *         running within a privileged process.
